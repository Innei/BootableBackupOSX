# BootableBackupOSX

A script to backup all your macOS files.

## Usage

Please put it under `~/` and execute like `cd ~; ./backup.sh`.

```
.
├── .backup_logs
├── .backupignore
└── backup.sh
```

I used this script to backup all my files, and it could be used to restore when setting up macOS.

## Thanks
